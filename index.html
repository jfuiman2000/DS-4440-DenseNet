<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Densely Connected Convolutional Network, or DenseNet, is a model architecture that leverage the fact that
  convolutional networks can be substantially deeper, more accurate, and efficient to train if they contain 
  shorter connections between layers close to the input and those close to the output. Instead of the traditional 
  convolutional networks with L layers have L connections - one between each layer and its subsequent layer - DenseNet
  has L(L+1)/2 direct connections. For each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are used as inputs, 
  and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers. As a result, DenseNet provides several
  compelling advantagesthey alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage
  feature euse, and substantially reduce the number of parameters.</p>
<p>On four highly competitive object recognition benchmark tasks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet),
  DenseNets seems to obtain significant accuracy to a previous Convolutional Network Architecture in class - ResNet.
  For our analysis, we want to explore and compare DenseNet to ResNet in terms of efficienecy/ Computational resource 
  use, Performance, and Applications, as well as exploring the limitation of DenseNet.

<h2>Paper Review</h2>
<img src="resource\DenseNet_Architecture.png" alt="Description of the image">

<p>DenseNet is a neural network architecture that was created to address the vanishing gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, 
 encourage feature reuse, and reduce the number of parameters. They work by connecting each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion,
 as opposed to ResNets and other CNNs where each layer is only connected to its subsequent layer. In other words, DenseNet layers combine features
 by concatenation, while ResNet layers combine features by summation. 
</p>

<p>Experimentation has revealed several significant attributes of DenseNets and highlighted their differences with ResNets. For example, 
 DenseNets perform better as the number of layers (L) and the growth rate (k) increases. This suggests that DenseNets can utilize the increased 
 representational power of bigger and deeper models. It also means that overfitting is not an issue with these networks. An important 
 difference that we have learned between DenseNets and ResNets is that DenseNets utilize their parameters much more efficiently than ResNets as well 
 as other architectures. There were instances in the testing where DenseNets outperformed the ResNets despite only having half the parameters. 
 The increased parametric efficiency has led to DenseNets being less prone to overfitting. These advantages are examples of why we should further 
 research DenseNet architecture to better understand how to create and improve these benefits.
