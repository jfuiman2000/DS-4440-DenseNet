<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Densely Connected Convolutional Network, or DenseNet, is a model architecture that leverage the fact that
  convolutional networks can be substantially deeper, more accurate, and efficient to train if they contain 
  shorter connections between layers close to the input and those close to the output. Instead of the traditional 
  convolutional networks with L layers have L connections - one between each layer and its subsequent layer - DenseNet
  has L(L+1)/2 direct connections. For each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are used as inputs, 
  and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers. As a result, DenseNet provides several
  compelling advantagesthey alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage
  feature euse, and substantially reduce the number of parameters.</p>
<p>On four highly competitive object recognition benchmark tasks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet),
  DenseNets seems to obtain significant accuracy to a previous Convolutional Network Architecture in class - ResNet.
  For our analysis, we want to explore and compare DenseNet to ResNet in terms of efficienecy/ Computational resource 
  use, Performance, and Applications, as well as exploring the limitation of DenseNet.
</p>
<h2>Paper Review</h2>


<p>We have talked about the problem of vanishing gradient where input or gradient after passing through many layers can vanish and "wash out" by
  the end of the network. The were many ways of tackling the problem: bypassing signal from one layer to the next via identity connections or
  randomly dropping layers during training to allow better information and gradient flow. Both of those approaches share a distinct characteristic:
  they create short paths from early layers to later layers.
</p>
<p>DenseNet was introduced as a way to distill this insight into an architecture: Instead of the traditional 
  convolutional networks with L layers have L connections - one between each layer and its subsequent layer - DenseNet
  has L(L+1)/2 direct connections. For each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are used as inputs, 
  and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers. Crucially, in contrast to ResNets, 
  DenseNet never combine features through summation before they are passed into a layer; instead, they combine 
  features by concatenating them. These features helps DenseNet achieve 3 effects: it requires fewer parameters, it avoid the vanishing-gradient
problem, and it provides a regularizing effect on small dataset</p>
<img src="resource\DenseNet_vs_ResNet.png" alt="Architecture">
<p>Having talked about DenseNet advantages, we also want to explore its drawbacks: Memory access cost grow
  quadratically for DenseNet compared to ResNet and also high memory usage due to its concatenating nature where 
  Due to the fact that for DenseNet, each downstream layer has to access all feature maps in the same Dense Block. Thus,
  we want to compare the two model against each other to see if one is better than th other.</p>

<h3>Section 3: Method & Implementation</h3>
<p>We will be training both untrained ResNet and DenseNet model with different depth on the <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/zh-plus/tiny-imagenet" 
  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TinyImageNet dataset</a> which is a smaller dataset of the ImageNet Dataset. On this dataset,
  we will evaluate both models in terms of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Accuracy</li>
  <li>Training time</li>
  <li>Parameters</li>
  <li>Whether vanishing gradient arise</li>
  <li>Cost Of Memory</li>
  <li>[Add more to list as needed]</li>
</ul>
